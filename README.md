# odin-recipes
This project is going to be a webpage recipes assignment from the odin project. I will use my html skills to creat pargraphs ad pictures and edit some text. 

Reflection: I was in a bit of a rush but im very happy with the out come considering I really did enjoy the actual work of me creating this website (even if the copywrite wasnt taken too seriously) and im really looking forward to starting this career!
